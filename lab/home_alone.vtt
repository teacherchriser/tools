00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:26.879
- Answer the phone.
- Where's my suitcase?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.842
I'm going downstairs.
Who stole my hair dryer?

00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:35.512
Miss. Young lady. Excuse me. Girls.

00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:38.682
Hey, hey, little boy.

00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:41.059
- Excuse me, girls. Girls.
- Take the witches!

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.312
Hey. Hey, big fella.
Excuse me.

00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:45.623
Come help me make up these
beds in the living room!

00:01:45.624 --> 00:01:46.732
Excuse me. Ma'am!

00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.234
- Hi. Hey, son! Son!
- Who stole my book bag?

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:52.939
Big fella! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Little guy. Little guy!

00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:57.284
Pete's brother and his family
are here. Oh, it's crazy.

00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:59.661
- Trish is going to Montreal.
- Montreal?

00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:01.788
- Uh-huh.
- That's right. Her family's there.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.790
- And we're off.
- When do you leave?

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:05.876
- Tomorrow.
- You're not ready, are you?

00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:10.714
Mom! Uncle Frank won't let me
watch the movie, but the big kids can.

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:13.592
- Why can't I?
- Kevin, I'm on the phone.

00:02:13.593 --> 00:02:16.178
When do you come back?
Not till then?

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.598
It's not even rated "R."
He's just being a jerk.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.935
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no...

00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:25.270
then it must be really bad.

00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:27.481
No, we're not bringing the dog.
We're putting him...

00:02:27.482 --> 00:02:30.025
Hey, hey, hey! Get off.
Kevin, out of the room.

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:32.528
Hang up the phone and make me,
why don't ya?

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:33.338
Oh, this kid.

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.532
Kate, did you by any chance pick
up a voltage adapter thing?

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.534
I didn't have time to do that.

00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:40.536
How am I supposed
to shave in France?

00:02:40.537 --> 00:02:43.539
- Grow a goatee.
- Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.541
I've got something
for you to do.

00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:48.126
Pick up those Micro Machines
that are all over in there.

00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:51.088
Aunt Leslie stepped on one
and almost broke her neck.

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.096
He was in the garage again
playing with the glue gun.

00:02:53.097 --> 00:02:54.258
Didn't we talk about that?

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.386
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.

00:02:57.387 --> 00:02:59.638
I was making ornaments
out of fishhooks.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.473
My new fishhooks?

00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:06.311
I can't make ornaments out of the old ones,
with dry worm guts stuck on 'em.

00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:10.315
- Peter.
- Come on, Kevin. Out.

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:12.901
Peter, Kate, do you guys
have a voltage adapter?

00:03:12.902 --> 00:03:16.196
- Here! Here's a voltage adapter.
- Oh, you're getting heavy.

00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:18.566
Go pack your suitcase.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.744
Pack my suitcase?

00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:25.330
- Do you know where the shampoo is, Fuller?
- I don't live here.

00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:27.833
A house with this many people,
there's no shampoo?

00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:30.127
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah, but they don't live here.

00:03:30.128 --> 00:03:32.880
- Tracy, did you order the pizza?
- Buzz did.

00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:36.258
- Excuse me, miss. Are your parents here?
- My parents live in Paris. Sorry.

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.260
- Hi!
- Hi!

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:39.928
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah.

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.930
- Do they live here?
- No.

00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:47.019
No. Why should they? All kids, no parents.
Probably a fancy orphanage.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.190
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.
I've never done this once in my whole life.

00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:53.525
- Tough.
- That's what Megan said.

00:03:53.526 --> 00:03:56.361
- What did I say?
- You told Kevin, "tough."

00:03:56.362 --> 00:03:59.198
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What am I supposed to do?

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.742
Shake his hand and say,
"Congratulations, you're an idiot"?

00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:04.786
- I'm not an idiot!
- Oh, really? You're completely helpless!

00:04:04.787 --> 00:04:07.581
- Everyone has to do everything for you.
- She's right, Kev.

00:04:07.582 --> 00:04:11.543
Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm a lot smaller than you.
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.

00:04:11.544 --> 00:04:15.214
- I hope you didn't just pack crap, Jeff.
- Shut up, Linnie.

00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:17.216
Do you know what I should pack?

00:04:17.217 --> 00:04:20.636
Buzz told you, cheek-face.
Toilet paper and water.

00:04:20.637 --> 00:04:23.680
Listen, Kev, what are
you so worried about?

00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:26.558
You know mom's gonna pack
your stuff anyway.

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:29.895
You're what the French call
les incompetents.

00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:34.058
- What?
- Bombs away!

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.990
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.

00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:45.869
If he has something to drink,
he's gonna wet the bed.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.747
This house is so full of people,
it makes me sick!

00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:51.875
When I grow up and get married,
I'm livin' alone!

00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:54.753
Did you hear me?
I'm livin' alone!

00:04:54.754 --> 00:04:57.707
I'm livin' alone!

00:04:59.968 --> 00:05:02.386
Who's gonna feed your spider
while we're gone?

00:05:02.387 --> 00:05:06.966
He just ate a whole load of mice guts.
He should be good for a couple weeks.

00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:11.520
Is it true that French babes
don't shave their pits?

00:05:11.521 --> 00:05:14.273
Some don't.

00:05:14.274 --> 00:05:16.275
But they got nude beaches.

00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:19.520
Not in the winter.

00:05:23.783 --> 00:05:27.870
- Buzz?
- Don't you know how to knock, phlegm-wad?

00:05:27.871 --> 00:05:31.456
Can I sleep in your room?
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.

00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:33.542
If he has something to drink,
he'll wet the bed.

00:05:33.543 --> 00:05:38.373
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room
if you were growing on my ass.

00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:43.336
Check it out.
Old man Marley.

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.765
Who is he?

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:53.187
You ever heard
of the South Bend Shovel Slayer!

00:05:53.188 --> 00:05:55.230
- No.
- That's him.

00:05:55.231 --> 00:06:00.186
Back in '58, he murdered his whole family
and half the people on his block...

00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:03.572
with a snow shovel.

00:06:03.573 --> 00:06:06.992
Been hiding out
in this neighborhood ever since.

00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:10.579
Well, if he's the Shovel Slayer,
how come the cops don't arrest him?

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.581
Not enough evidence to convict.

00:06:12.582 --> 00:06:15.250
They never found the bodies.

00:06:15.251 --> 00:06:17.586
But everyone around here
knows he did it.

00:06:17.587 --> 00:06:21.423
Now it'll just be a matter of time
before he does it again.

00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:23.509
What's he doin' now?

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.513
He walks up and down
the streets every night...

00:06:27.514 --> 00:06:29.932
salting the sidewalks.

00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:32.093
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:35.979
No way.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.107
See that garbage can full of salt?

00:06:39.108 --> 00:06:42.194
That's where he keeps his victims.

00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:45.197
The salt turns the bodies...

00:06:45.198 --> 00:06:48.075
into mummies.

00:06:48.076 --> 00:06:51.237
- Wow.
- Mummies.

00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:57.618
Look out!

00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:32.077
How you kids doin', huh? Good?

00:07:32.078 --> 00:07:34.913
Lot of action
around here today, huh?

00:07:34.914 --> 00:07:37.708
Goin' on vacation?
Where you goin'?

00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:42.087
Do you hear me or what?
Goin' on a trip?

00:07:42.088 --> 00:07:44.374
Where you goin', kid?

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.602
Okay, that's 122.50.

00:07:56.603 --> 00:07:58.687
Not for me, kid.
I don't live here.

00:07:58.688 --> 00:08:02.774
- Oh. You just around for the holidays?
- I guess you could say that.

00:08:02.775 --> 00:08:06.236
- Hey, pizza's here!
- Here you go. That's 122.50.

00:08:06.237 --> 00:08:08.947
It's my brother's house.
He'll take care of it.

00:08:08.948 --> 00:08:12.284
Hey, listen, uh...

00:08:12.285 --> 00:08:15.787
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you Mr. McCallister?

00:08:15.788 --> 00:08:18.248
- Yeah.
- The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:21.376
- Yes.
- Oh, good, 'cause somebody owes me 122.50.

00:08:21.377 --> 00:08:24.963
- I'd like a word with you, sir.
- Am I under arrest or something?

00:08:24.964 --> 00:08:28.926
No, no. It's Christmastime. There's always
a lot of burglaries around the holidays.

00:08:28.927 --> 00:08:33.388
We're checking the neighborhood to see if
everyone's taking the proper precautions.

00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:37.643
Oh, yeah. Well, we have automatic timers
for our lights, locks for our doors.

00:08:37.644 --> 00:08:39.811
That's about as well
as anybody can do these days.

00:08:39.812 --> 00:08:42.147
- You get some eggnog?
- Come on, Dad.

00:08:42.148 --> 00:08:44.149
- Let's eat.
- Come on.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.407
- Eggnog? Listen, are you
gonna be leaving, uh...

00:08:46.408 --> 00:08:47.236
- Pizza! Pizza!

00:08:47.237 --> 00:08:49.321
Pizza!

00:08:49.322 --> 00:08:52.449
Grab yourself a napkin.
You're gonna have to pour your own drinks.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.660
Does Santa Claus have
to go through customs?

00:08:54.661 --> 00:08:56.995
- What time do we have to go to bed?
- Early.

00:08:56.996 --> 00:08:59.581
We're leaving the house
at 8:00 a.m. on the button.

00:08:59.582 --> 00:09:03.877
I hope you're all drinking milk. I want
to get rid of it. Hey! Don't you dare.

00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:07.081
Honey, the pizza boy needs
$122.50, plus a tip.

00:09:07.082 --> 00:09:08.173
For pizza?

00:09:08.174 --> 00:09:10.092
Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.

00:09:10.093 --> 00:09:12.719
- Frank, you've got money. Come on.
- Traveler's checks.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.681
Forget it, Frank.
We have cash.

00:09:15.682 --> 00:09:18.475
You've probably got traveler's
checks that don't work in France.

00:09:18.476 --> 00:09:21.520
Did anyone order me
a plain cheese?

00:09:21.521 --> 00:09:24.064
Oh, yeah, we did.
But if you want any...

00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:27.442
somebody's gonna have
to barf it all up, 'cause it's gone.

00:09:27.443 --> 00:09:31.147
Fuller!
Go easy on the Pepsi.

00:09:37.495 --> 00:09:41.324
Kev! Kevin, get a plate.

00:09:47.797 --> 00:09:50.174
Wow!

00:09:50.175 --> 00:09:53.051
The passports! Watch it!

00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:56.305
Help me out here!

00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:59.224
Let's get these passports
out of here.

00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:02.811
- Kevin, get off of him!
- You moron!

00:10:02.812 --> 00:10:06.481
Are you okay, honey?
Come here. Are you all right?

00:10:06.482 --> 00:10:08.358
What is the matter with you?

00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:11.361
He started it!
He ate my pizza on purpose.

00:10:11.362 --> 00:10:13.739
He knows I hate sausage
and olives and...

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.359
Look what you did,
you little jerk!

00:10:30.215 --> 00:10:32.424
- Kevin, get upstairs right now.
- Why?

00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:35.761
- Kevin, you're such a disease.
- Shut up.

00:10:35.762 --> 00:10:37.596
- Kevin, upstairs!
- Say good night, Kevin.

00:10:37.597 --> 00:10:41.934
- Good night, Kevin.
- Now what's for dinner?

00:10:41.935 --> 00:10:44.353
Why do I always get treated
like scum?

00:10:44.354 --> 00:10:46.813
Oh, I'm sorry.
This house is just crazy.

00:10:46.814 --> 00:10:48.815
We've got all these
extra kids running around.

00:10:48.816 --> 00:10:52.611
My brother-in-law drove in
from Ohio today. It's just nuts.

00:10:52.612 --> 00:10:55.280
How come you didn't
bring more cheese pizzas?

00:10:55.281 --> 00:10:57.449
Nice tip. Thanks a lot.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.952
- Thanks.
- Having a reunion or something?

00:10:59.953 --> 00:11:01.954
My husband's brother transferred
to Paris last summer...

00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:05.958
and his kids are still going to school here,
and I guess he missed the whole family.

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:08.710
He's giving us this trip to Paris
so we can be together.

00:11:08.711 --> 00:11:12.589
- You're taking a trip to Paris?
- Yes, we hope to leave tomorrow morning.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.967
Excellent. Excellent.

00:11:14.968 --> 00:11:18.220
If you'll excuse me, this one's
out of sorts. I'll be right back.

00:11:18.221 --> 00:11:21.139
Don't worry about me.
I spoke to your husband already.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.433
And don't worry
about your home.

00:11:23.434 --> 00:11:26.012
It's in good hands.

00:11:28.648 --> 00:11:32.276
There are 15 people in this house. You're
the only one that has to make trouble.

00:11:32.277 --> 00:11:35.445
- I'm the only one getting dumped on.
- You're the only one acting up.

00:11:35.446 --> 00:11:40.158
- Now get upstairs.
- I am upstairs, dummy.

00:11:40.159 --> 00:11:42.828
- The third floor?
- Go.

00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:46.164
- It's scary up there.
- Don't be silly. Fuller will be up in a little while.

00:11:46.165 --> 00:11:49.459
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.
You know about him. He wets the bed.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.753
He'll pee all over me.
I know it.

00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:53.839
Fine. We'll put him
somewhere else.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.508
I'm sorry.

00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:59.212
It's too late.
Get upstairs.

00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:04.183
Everyone in this family hates me.

00:12:04.184 --> 00:12:06.518
Then maybe you should ask Santa
for a new family.

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:10.314
I don't want a new family!
I don't want any family! Families suck!

00:12:10.315 --> 00:12:13.609
Stay up there. I don't want to
see you for the rest of the night.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.361
I don't want to see you
for the rest of my life.

00:12:16.362 --> 00:12:19.156
And I don't want to see
anybody else either.

00:12:19.157 --> 00:12:21.200
I hope you don't mean that.

00:12:21.201 --> 00:12:25.287
You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up tomorrow
morning and you didn't have a family.

00:12:25.288 --> 00:12:28.874
- No, I wouldn't.
- Then say it again.

00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:33.496
- Maybe it'll happen.
- I hope I never see any of you jerks again.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.645
I wish they would all just disappear.

00:13:54.294 --> 00:13:57.830
- Where are they?
- I don't know. She said 8:00 sharp.

00:14:06.055 --> 00:14:09.558
Peter!

00:14:09.559 --> 00:14:11.719
We slept in!

00:14:28.286 --> 00:14:31.413
Hi. I'm Mitch Murphy.
I live across the street.

00:14:31.414 --> 00:14:34.917
You guys going out of town?
We're going to Orlando, Florida.

00:14:34.918 --> 00:14:38.670
Well, actually, first we're going
to Missouri to pick up my grandma.

00:14:38.671 --> 00:14:41.340
Do you know the McCallisters
are going to France?

00:14:41.341 --> 00:14:45.219
Do you know if it's cold there?
Do these vans get good gas mileage?

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.381
Gee, kid, I don't know.
Hit the road.

00:14:51.017 --> 00:14:53.310
Heather, do a head count.
Make sure everyone's in the vans.

00:14:53.311 --> 00:14:55.312
Where are the passports
and tickets?

00:14:55.313 --> 00:14:57.314
I put 'em in the microwave
to dry 'em off.

00:14:57.315 --> 00:14:59.316
How fast does this thing go?

00:14:59.317 --> 00:15:03.362
Does it have automatic transmission?
Does it have four-wheel drive?

00:15:03.363 --> 00:15:07.734
Look, I told you before, kid,
don't bother me. Now beat it.

00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:17.160
Come on. Hurry up.

00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:22.631
- Line up in front off the van.
- Did you take my batteries?

00:15:22.632 --> 00:15:25.092
- Line up and shut up!
- Wow!

00:15:25.093 --> 00:15:27.886
Shut up.
I gotta take a head count.

00:15:27.887 --> 00:15:32.057
- One, two, three, four, five...
- Eleven, 92, 12.

00:15:32.058 --> 00:15:34.560
Buzz, don't be a moron.

00:15:34.561 --> 00:15:37.896
Six, seven, eight...

00:15:37.897 --> 00:15:40.566
nine, 10, 11.

00:15:40.567 --> 00:15:43.861
Okay. Half in this van, half in this van.
Come on. Let's go.

00:15:43.862 --> 00:15:46.488
Have a good trip.

00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:48.691
Bring me back something French.

00:15:51.244 --> 00:15:55.247
There's no way on earth we're gonna
make this plane. It leaves in 45 minutes.

00:15:55.248 --> 00:15:58.667
- Think positive, Frank.
- You be positive. I'll be realistic.

00:15:58.668 --> 00:16:00.669
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- What?

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.754
I wanted to let you know
your power's fixed.

00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:06.383
Phone lines are a mess. Gonna take Ma
Bell a couple of days to patch 'em up.

00:16:06.384 --> 00:16:08.927
- Especially around the holidays.
- Okay, thanks.

00:16:08.928 --> 00:16:12.347
- Heather! Did you count heads?
- Eleven, including me.

00:16:12.348 --> 00:16:17.345
Five boys, six girls, four parents, two
drivers and a partridge in a pear tree.

00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:51.970
This way!

00:16:51.971 --> 00:16:55.557
- Hold the plane!
- Did we miss the flight?

00:16:55.558 --> 00:16:58.227
No, you just made it.

00:16:58.228 --> 00:17:02.439
- Single seats only in coach. Take whatever's free.
- Thank you.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.809
I get a window seat!

00:17:06.986 --> 00:17:09.154
You kids are in coach.
We're up here.

00:17:09.155 --> 00:17:11.990
Here are your seats. Five "A"and "B"
and four "A"and "B."

00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:14.993
- I'll take your coats.
- Thank you.

00:17:14.994 --> 00:17:16.995
Fasten your seat belts, please.

00:17:16.996 --> 00:17:19.665
- Champagne, please. It's free, isn't it?
- Oh, yes.

00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:23.377
- We made it.
- Do you believe it?

00:17:23.378 --> 00:17:25.747
Hope we didn't forget anything.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.051
What are you doing
out of costume?

00:18:13.052 --> 00:18:15.053
Now get back and get dressed.

00:18:15.054 --> 00:18:17.222
I'm terribly sorry.
I thought you were our Santa Claus.

00:18:17.223 --> 00:18:19.224
Your Santa Claus is intoxicated.

00:18:19.225 --> 00:18:21.476
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

00:18:21.477 --> 00:18:24.722
It's disgraceful!
How can you allow a man...

00:18:29.944 --> 00:18:32.779
What do you mean by drinking?
You know it's not allowed!

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.575
But it's cold.
A man's gotta do something to keep warm.

00:18:36.576 --> 00:18:38.577
I ought to take this cane and...

00:18:38.578 --> 00:18:43.248
Julia, get some black
coffee and plenty of it.

00:18:43.249 --> 00:18:45.292
Black with a little cream.

00:18:45.293 --> 00:18:47.704
Mom?

00:18:52.509 --> 00:18:55.385
Thank you.

00:18:55.386 --> 00:18:58.680
- That's real crystal. It's real.
- Yeah. So?

00:18:58.681 --> 00:19:03.018
- Put 'em in your purse. Put 'em! Put 'em!
- I can't do that.

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:05.020
Put them in your purse!

00:19:05.021 --> 00:19:09.274
Uh, yeah, yeah, fill it up, fill it up.
Fill it up, please.

00:19:09.275 --> 00:19:11.276
Thank you.

00:19:11.277 --> 00:19:14.780
Don't you feel like a heel flying first
class with the kids back in coach?

00:19:14.781 --> 00:19:16.782
No, the kids are fine.

00:19:16.783 --> 00:19:20.994
Only flying I ever did as a kid was in the
family station wagon, and it wasn't to France.

00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:24.456
We used to have to go over
to Aunt Laura and Uncle Arthur's house.

00:19:24.457 --> 00:19:26.751
The kids are okay. They're
having the time of their lives.

00:19:26.752 --> 00:19:27.518
Yeah.

00:19:28.419 --> 00:19:30.580
Hello?

00:19:31.548 --> 00:19:33.708
Mom?

00:19:35.301 --> 00:19:37.462
Dad?

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.593
Mom? Dad?

00:19:45.436 --> 00:19:48.272
Where are you guys?

00:19:48.273 --> 00:19:50.433
Buzz?

00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:53.811
Buzz?

00:19:56.614 --> 00:19:58.775
Buzz?

00:20:02.328 --> 00:20:04.329
Megan?

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:09.001
Hello? Hello?

00:20:09.002 --> 00:20:12.087
Rod? Uncle Frank?

00:20:12.088 --> 00:20:14.582
Uncle Frank, is this a joke?

00:20:16.259 --> 00:20:19.379
Megan? Linnie?

00:20:21.806 --> 00:20:23.966
Is this a joke?

00:20:46.998 --> 00:20:51.661
It's only my imagination.
Only my imagination.

00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:12.265
The cars are still here.
They didn't go to the airport.

00:21:29.999 --> 00:21:33.953
I made my family disappear.

00:21:34.879 --> 00:21:37.130
Kevin, you're completely helpless.

00:21:37.131 --> 00:21:41.802
You know, Kevin, you're what
the French call les incompetents.

00:21:41.803 --> 00:21:45.138
Kevin, I'm going to feed you
to my tarantula.

00:21:45.139 --> 00:21:48.267
Kevin, you are such a disease.

00:21:48.268 --> 00:21:50.561
There are 15 people
in this house...

00:21:50.562 --> 00:21:53.438
and you're the only one
who has to make trouble.

00:21:53.439 --> 00:21:56.976
Look what you did,
you little jerk.

00:22:00.613 --> 00:22:03.941
I made my family disappear.

00:22:18.089 --> 00:22:22.335
I'm free! Free! Free!

00:22:32.061 --> 00:22:34.222
Wow!

00:22:39.986 --> 00:22:43.822
No clothes on anybody.
Sickening!

00:22:43.823 --> 00:22:48.076
Cool! Firecrackers!
I'll save these for later.

00:22:48.077 --> 00:22:51.163
Buzz, I'm going through
all your private stuff!

00:22:51.164 --> 00:22:54.283
You better come out
and pound me!

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.873
Buzz, your girlfriend!
Woof!

00:23:49.472 --> 00:23:51.632
Who is it?

00:23:54.894 --> 00:23:57.896
It's me, Snakes.
I got the stuff.

00:23:57.897 --> 00:24:01.108
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell out of here.

00:24:01.109 --> 00:24:04.403
All right, Johnny.
But what about my money?

00:24:04.404 --> 00:24:08.073
- What money?
- Acey said you had some dough for me.

00:24:08.074 --> 00:24:11.159
Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.079
Acey said 10%.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.915
Too bad Acey ain't
in charge no more.

00:24:16.916 --> 00:24:19.918
- What do you mean?
- Guys, I'm eating junk and watching rubbish!

00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:22.963
You better come out
and stop me!

00:24:22.964 --> 00:24:25.716
He'll call you when he gets out.

00:24:25.717 --> 00:24:27.509
Hey.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.421
I tell you what I'm gonna
give you, Snakes.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.266
I'm gonna give you
to the count of 10...

00:24:34.267 --> 00:24:37.436
to get your ugly, yellow...

00:24:37.437 --> 00:24:39.688
no-good keister off my property...

00:24:39.689 --> 00:24:41.899
before I pump your guts
full of lead.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.568
All right, Johnny, I'm sorry.
I'm goin'.

00:24:44.569 --> 00:24:47.271
One, two, ten!

00:25:02.378 --> 00:25:04.997
Keep the change,
ya filthy animal.

00:25:06.466 --> 00:25:08.209
Mom!

00:25:19.354 --> 00:25:22.022
What's the matter?

00:25:22.023 --> 00:25:24.525
Honey?

00:25:24.526 --> 00:25:28.271
- I have a terrible feeling.
- About what?

00:25:29.155 --> 00:25:31.406
That we didn't do something.

00:25:31.407 --> 00:25:34.826
Oh, no, you feel that way
because we left in such a hurry.

00:25:34.827 --> 00:25:36.880
We took care of everything.
Believe me, we did.

00:25:36.881 --> 00:25:38.247
Did I turn off the coffee?

00:25:38.248 --> 00:25:41.208
No. I did.

00:25:41.209 --> 00:25:43.335
Did you lock up?

00:25:43.336 --> 00:25:45.337
Yeah.

00:25:45.338 --> 00:25:48.166
Did you close the garage?

00:25:50.009 --> 00:25:54.005
That's it. I forgot to close
the garage. That's it.

00:25:59.394 --> 00:26:01.929
No, that's not it.

00:26:02.897 --> 00:26:05.308
What else could we be forgetting?

00:26:09.028 --> 00:26:11.439
Kevin!

00:26:37.515 --> 00:26:40.343
Whoa!

00:26:41.186 --> 00:26:45.139
Whoa! Whoa!

00:26:53.698 --> 00:26:56.992
The captain's doing all he can.
Your phones are still out of order.

00:26:56.993 --> 00:27:01.496
We'll call as soon as we land, Kate.
I'm sure everything's okay.

00:27:01.497 --> 00:27:05.250
It's horrible. Horrible.
Just horrible.

00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:08.420
How could we do this?
We forgot him.

00:27:08.421 --> 00:27:10.873
We didn't forget him.
We just... miscounted.

00:27:11.841 --> 00:27:14.176
What kind of mother am I?

00:27:14.177 --> 00:27:18.089
If it makes you feel any better,
I forgot my reading glasses.

00:27:22.602 --> 00:27:25.354
Five families gone on one block alone.

00:27:25.355 --> 00:27:28.315
- They all told me from their own mouths.

00:27:28.316 --> 00:27:30.400
It's almost too easy.

00:27:30.401 --> 00:27:34.363
Check it out. All the houses
with nobody home...

00:27:34.364 --> 00:27:37.616
have automatic timers
on their lights.

00:27:37.617 --> 00:27:40.653
But I got it all figured out.
Watch this.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.582
Number 664 will be going on...

00:27:45.583 --> 00:27:48.995
right about... now.

00:27:50.547 --> 00:27:53.715
- Oh.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:27:53.716 --> 00:27:56.461
Number 672...

00:27:57.554 --> 00:28:00.305
right... now.

00:28:00.306 --> 00:28:03.642
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

00:28:03.643 --> 00:28:08.056
671... now.

00:28:09.983 --> 00:28:13.443
And that's the one, Marvin.
That's the silver tuna.

00:28:13.444 --> 00:28:15.654
Oh, it's very "G."

00:28:15.655 --> 00:28:18.699
Very "G, " huh?
It's loaded.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.243
It's got lots of topflight goods.

00:28:21.244 --> 00:28:24.788
- Stereos, VCR's.
- Toys.

00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:29.334
Probably lookin' at some very fine jewelry.
Possible cash hoard.

00:28:29.335 --> 00:28:33.672
Odd marketable securities.
Who knows?

00:28:33.673 --> 00:28:36.008
It's a gem.

00:28:36.009 --> 00:28:38.169
Grab your crowbar.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.381
Crowbars up.

00:29:40.156 --> 00:29:40.990
Which way?

00:29:40.991 --> 00:29:44.427
We'll go around back to the basement.
Follow me.

00:30:04.097 --> 00:30:06.265
I thought you said
they were gone.

00:30:06.266 --> 00:30:10.303
- They were supposed to leave this morning.
- Let's get out of here.

00:30:46.639 --> 00:30:49.308
We have to use the phone, please.

00:30:49.309 --> 00:30:52.144
It's an emergency.
We really have to make a call.

00:30:52.145 --> 00:30:55.314
Please! Our brother's home alone.

00:30:55.315 --> 00:30:58.650
- Give us the phone!
- Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you.

00:30:58.651 --> 00:31:01.737
Peter, I'm gonna call the police.
Why don't you book us a flight home.

00:31:01.738 --> 00:31:06.491
Get some change out of here.
Call everybody you know. Oh. Leslie.

00:31:06.492 --> 00:31:09.786
Here's my address book. You and Frank
call everybody who lives on our street.

00:31:09.787 --> 00:31:11.788
Maybe somebody can help us.

00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:16.077
Hello? Hello? Hello?
She'll have to call you back.

00:31:21.007 --> 00:31:25.010
This is ridiculous. Only a wimp
would be hiding under a bed.

00:31:25.011 --> 00:31:29.340
And I can't be a wimp.
I'm the man of the house.

00:31:36.439 --> 00:31:39.517
Hey! I'm not afraid anymore!

00:31:40.777 --> 00:31:44.863
I said, I'm not afraid anymore!

00:31:44.864 --> 00:31:47.900
Do you hear me?
I'm not afraid anymore!

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.732
Village Police Department.

00:32:20.733 --> 00:32:24.403
Hi. Look, I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

00:32:24.404 --> 00:32:27.906
Our phones are out of order,
so I'd like somebody to go to our house...

00:32:27.907 --> 00:32:29.908
and tell him we're
coming home to get him.

00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:32.077
Let me connect you with
Family Crisis Intervention.

00:32:32.078 --> 00:32:35.114
- It's not a family crisis.
- Hold on.

00:32:36.791 --> 00:32:40.419
Larry, can you pick up? There's some
lady on hold, sounds kind of hyper.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.255
- What line, Rose?
- Uh, two.

00:32:43.256 --> 00:32:45.924
Family Crisis Intervention.
Sergeant Balzak.

00:32:45.925 --> 00:32:49.052
I am calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

00:32:49.053 --> 00:32:51.054
Has the child been involved
in a violent altercation...

00:32:51.055 --> 00:32:53.932
with a drunken and/or mentally ill
member of his immediate family?

00:32:53.933 --> 00:32:58.020
- No.
- Has he been involved in a household accident?

00:32:58.021 --> 00:33:00.355
I don't know. I don't...
I hope not.

00:33:00.356 --> 00:33:02.941
Has the child ingested any poison...

00:33:02.942 --> 00:33:05.736
and/or any other object that has become
lodged in his throat?

00:33:05.737 --> 00:33:09.448
No, he's just home alone! I would like
somebody to go over to the house...

00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:12.367
and see that he's all right,
just to check on him.

00:33:12.368 --> 00:33:16.121
You want us to go to your house
just to check on him?

00:33:16.122 --> 00:33:16.831
Yes!

00:33:16.832 --> 00:33:19.625
Let me connect you with
the police department.

00:33:19.626 --> 00:33:22.252
- They just transferred me to you.
- Rose?

00:33:22.253 --> 00:33:24.796
- Yeah?
- Hyper on two. Hold on, please.

00:33:24.797 --> 00:33:28.800
No, please don't hang up.
Please, don't... Any luck?

00:33:28.801 --> 00:33:32.554
No. We couldn't get anybody.

00:33:32.555 --> 00:33:33.339
Leslie?

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.576
I'm sorry, Kate. Nothing but a
bunch of answering machines.

00:33:38.603 --> 00:33:42.314
Somebody pick up.
Pick up!

00:33:42.315 --> 00:33:44.983
- Hi, ma'am. It's you again.
- Yeah, hi. Look.

00:33:44.984 --> 00:33:47.945
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone, and I...

00:33:47.946 --> 00:33:52.108
Okay, okay. We'll send a policeman
over to your house to check on your son.

00:34:22.146 --> 00:34:24.898
There's no one home.
The house looks secure.

00:34:24.899 --> 00:34:28.110
- Tell 'em to count their kids again.
Ten-four.

00:34:28.111 --> 00:34:30.779
I can't believe you can't
bump somebody or ask somebody...

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.532
I'm sorry, but there's
no way I can do that.

00:34:33.533 --> 00:34:35.534
Isn't there a way
if you ask somebody?

00:34:35.535 --> 00:34:38.203
- If you explained this is an emergency.
- I wish I could...

00:34:38.204 --> 00:34:40.789
They're sending a policeman over
to the house to check on Kevin.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:45.210
- That's a relief. Everything here is booked.
- There's nothing to Chicago?

00:34:45.211 --> 00:34:48.630
There's nothing to Chicago, New York,
Nashville. You name it. Everything's gone.

00:34:48.631 --> 00:34:53.135
- What about a private plane?
- No, I'm sorry. We don't do that.

00:34:53.136 --> 00:34:56.221
The only thing they have is a booking
for all of us on Friday morning.

00:34:56.222 --> 00:34:58.557
Friday morning?
That's two days away.

00:34:58.558 --> 00:35:01.143
Look, honey, the kids are exhausted.
You are exhausted.

00:35:01.144 --> 00:35:03.896
There's absolutely nothing more
we can do in this airport.

00:35:03.897 --> 00:35:08.066
I say we go to Rob's, we can call the
police, and they can get back to us.

00:35:08.067 --> 00:35:11.987
Kevin is home all by himself. I'm not
leaving here unless it's on an airplane.

00:35:11.988 --> 00:35:13.989
Madame, we are doing
everything we can.

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:18.035
If you want to stay at the airport,
maybe we can get you on a standby.

00:35:18.036 --> 00:35:21.580
It is a possibility
that a seat will open up.

00:35:21.581 --> 00:35:24.867
- Is that okay?
- Yes. I'll wait.

00:35:29.756 --> 00:35:33.467
- Bye. I'll miss you.
- Bye.

00:35:33.468 --> 00:35:36.553
- Find Kevin.

00:35:36.554 --> 00:35:38.597
Don't you get lost.

00:35:38.598 --> 00:35:40.849
Good-bye.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:42.969
Good-bye, Kate.

00:35:56.616 --> 00:36:00.244
I took a shower, washing
every body part with actual soap...

00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:04.831
including all my major crevices, including
in between my toes and in my belly button...

00:36:04.832 --> 00:36:07.417
which I never did before,
but sort of enjoyed.

00:36:07.418 --> 00:36:10.128
I washed my hair
with adult-formula shampoo...

00:36:10.129 --> 00:36:13.423
and used cream rinse
for that just-washed shine.

00:36:13.424 --> 00:36:17.511
I can't seem to find my toothbrush,
so I'll pick one up when I go out today.

00:36:17.512 --> 00:36:19.756
Other than that,
I'm in good shape.

00:36:53.923 --> 00:36:56.042
Whoa!

00:37:09.772 --> 00:37:13.184
All right!
Buzz's life savings.

00:37:40.136 --> 00:37:43.214
I thought the Murphys
went to Florida.

00:37:58.905 --> 00:38:02.574
You know, you're one of the great
cat burglars of the world, Marv.

00:38:02.575 --> 00:38:04.775
You think you could keep
it down a little in there?

00:38:05.245 --> 00:38:10.123
Hi, you've reached the Murphys. Please
leave a message after you hear the beep.

00:38:10.124 --> 00:38:15.045
Chuck, this is Peter McCallister again, and
we're still in Paris at my brother's apartment.

00:38:15.046 --> 00:38:18.257
Let me give you the number here, okay?
The country code is 3-3.

00:38:18.258 --> 00:38:20.259
The area code is 1-4.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:24.596
- And the number is 694-8764.
- Hey, Harry?

00:38:24.597 --> 00:38:25.415
Yeah?

00:38:25.416 --> 00:38:28.684
House we were at last night,
was that the McCallisters?

00:38:28.685 --> 00:38:31.228
- Yeah.
- Call me in Paris.

00:38:31.229 --> 00:38:33.973
You're right. They're gone.

00:38:37.193 --> 00:38:40.229
- I knew they were.
- Silver tuna tonight.

00:38:42.198 --> 00:38:44.358
Wow.

00:38:49.289 --> 00:38:51.373
How may I help you?

00:38:51.374 --> 00:38:55.294
Is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

00:38:55.295 --> 00:38:58.213
Well, I don't know.

00:38:58.214 --> 00:39:02.168
- It doesn't say, hon.
- Can you please find out?

00:39:04.971 --> 00:39:07.097
- Herb!
- Yeah?

00:39:07.098 --> 00:39:11.094
I've got a question here
about a toothbrush.

00:39:16.441 --> 00:39:20.819
Do you know, is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.939
I don't know.

00:39:43.593 --> 00:39:48.096
- Just tell him that...
- Oh, hon, you pay for that here.

00:39:48.097 --> 00:39:50.098
Why don't you just
tell him it's approved?

00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:53.519
Wait, son, you have to pay
for that toothbrush. Son?

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.604
Son! Hey!

00:39:55.605 --> 00:39:59.517
Jimmy! Stop that boy!

00:40:02.779 --> 00:40:06.274
Hey! Hey!

00:40:08.034 --> 00:40:09.986
Shoplifter!

00:40:13.039 --> 00:40:14.998
Hey! Hey, kid!

00:40:14.999 --> 00:40:17.709
Come back here!

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.621
Watch it!

00:40:21.798 --> 00:40:23.715
Come back here!

00:40:23.716 --> 00:40:27.795
Stop it, will ya!
Come here!

00:40:30.223 --> 00:40:32.592
Whoa! Whoa!

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:37.597
Whoa! Whoa!

00:40:39.732 --> 00:40:42.560
Yeehaw!

00:41:06.217 --> 00:41:08.378
I'm a criminal.

00:41:35.371 --> 00:41:38.165
What's so funny?

00:41:38.166 --> 00:41:41.035
What's so funny?
What are you laughin' at?

00:41:43.463 --> 00:41:45.547
You did it again, didn't you?

00:41:45.548 --> 00:41:48.300
You left the water runnin', didn't you?

00:41:48.301 --> 00:41:51.637
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to do it.

00:41:51.638 --> 00:41:53.639
Harry, it's our calling card.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.475
- Calling card.
- All the great ones leave their mark.

00:41:56.476 --> 00:41:58.477
We're the "Wet Bandits."

00:41:58.478 --> 00:42:01.438
You're sick, you know that?
You're really sick.

00:42:01.439 --> 00:42:03.440
- I'm not sick.
- Yes, you are.

00:42:03.441 --> 00:42:05.560
- I'm not sick!
- That's a sick thing to do!

00:42:12.116 --> 00:42:14.827
- We don't need that heat.
- Don't tell me what to do.

00:42:14.828 --> 00:42:16.245
I can do it if I want to.

00:42:16.246 --> 00:42:19.122
- You're sick.
- I'm not sick.

00:42:19.123 --> 00:42:22.410
- Hey, watch out!

00:42:28.716 --> 00:42:32.427
Hey. Hey! You gotta watch out
for traffic, son, you know?

00:42:32.428 --> 00:42:34.930
- Sorry.
- Damn.

00:42:34.931 --> 00:42:37.307
Santy don't visit
the funeral homes, little buddy.

00:42:37.308 --> 00:42:39.601
Okay, okay.

00:42:39.602 --> 00:42:43.097
Merry Christmas.

00:42:52.323 --> 00:42:55.784
- What's the matter?
- I don't like the way that kid looked at me.

00:42:55.785 --> 00:42:57.786
- Did you see that?
- You ever seen him before?

00:42:57.787 --> 00:43:00.622
I saw a hundred kids this week.

00:43:00.623 --> 00:43:03.284
Let's see what house
he goes into.

00:43:34.741 --> 00:43:37.075
Why is he goin' faster?

00:43:37.076 --> 00:43:41.697
I told you something's wrong. I knew
he looked at me weird. Why would he run?

00:44:16.908 --> 00:44:21.078
- Maybe he went in the church.
- I'm not goin' in there.

00:44:21.079 --> 00:44:24.031
- Me neither.
- Ah, let's get out of here.

00:44:42.475 --> 00:44:45.803
When those guys come back,
I'll be ready.

00:45:11.296 --> 00:45:14.040
- Did they come back?
- From Paris?

00:45:49.542 --> 00:45:52.544
We'll come back tomorrow.
Maybe they'll be gone by then.

00:45:52.545 --> 00:45:56.833
We'd better get out of here
before somebody sees us.

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:27.621
Attention! Attention!

00:46:27.622 --> 00:46:31.667
- Look what I have found in "ze" kitchen!
- Frank, those are for later.

00:46:31.668 --> 00:46:33.828
Frank?

00:46:35.046 --> 00:46:39.007
Mes petites enfants,
do you want a little shrimp, eh?

00:46:39.008 --> 00:46:42.344
Oper... Do you speak English?

00:46:42.345 --> 00:46:45.264
Parlez anglais?

00:46:45.265 --> 00:46:47.307
Is there... I mean...

00:46:47.308 --> 00:46:52.354
Est ce qui un person
qui parle anglais?

00:46:52.355 --> 00:46:55.524
- Did you get anybody?
- I'm looking for my son! Do you know where he is?

00:46:55.525 --> 00:47:00.946
I can't find anybody. They've all gone
shopping. Nobody's home for the holidays.

00:47:00.947 --> 00:47:03.115
Never mind. Forget it.

00:47:03.116 --> 00:47:05.284
This is so pointless.

00:47:05.285 --> 00:47:09.121
- What?
- We're here rotting in this apartment.

00:47:09.122 --> 00:47:11.415
Kevin's at home.
Mom's at the airport.

00:47:11.416 --> 00:47:13.792
- So?
- You're not at all worried about Kevin?

00:47:13.793 --> 00:47:15.794
Why should I be?

00:47:15.795 --> 00:47:19.464
He's acted like a jerk too many times,
and this time he caught it in the butt.

00:47:19.465 --> 00:47:24.094
But he's so little and helpless.
Don't you think he's flipped out?

00:47:24.095 --> 00:47:27.389
The little trout can use
a couple of days in the real world.

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:29.808
You're not worried that something
might happen to him?

00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:32.394
No. For three reasons.

00:47:32.395 --> 00:47:35.147
I'm not that lucky.

00:47:35.148 --> 00:47:37.524
Two: We have smoke detectors.

00:47:37.525 --> 00:47:41.612
And "D": We live in the most boring street
in the United States of America...

00:47:41.613 --> 00:47:46.192
where nothing even remotely dangerous
will ever happen, period.

00:48:13.144 --> 00:48:16.647
- Who is it?
- It's Little Nero's, sir. I have your pizza.

00:48:16.648 --> 00:48:19.942
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell outta here.

00:48:19.943 --> 00:48:22.819
Okay.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.189
Um, well, what about the money?

00:48:26.199 --> 00:48:27.950
What money?

00:48:27.951 --> 00:48:31.453
Well, you have to pay
for your pizza, sir.

00:48:31.454 --> 00:48:33.789
Is that a fact?

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:36.041
How much do I owe you?

00:48:36.042 --> 00:48:39.537
Uh, that'll be 11.80, sir.

00:48:45.718 --> 00:48:49.255
Keep the change,
ya filthy animal.

00:48:50.932 --> 00:48:52.933
- Cheapskate.
- Hey.

00:48:52.934 --> 00:48:56.854
I'm gonna give you to the count
of 10 to get your ugly...

00:48:56.855 --> 00:49:00.232
yellow, no-good keister
off my property...

00:49:00.233 --> 00:49:02.568
before I pump your guts
full of lead.

00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:04.645
One, two, ten!

00:49:33.433 --> 00:49:36.636
A lovely cheese pizza
just for me.

00:49:39.939 --> 00:49:42.308
To Dallas-Fort Worth.

00:49:45.528 --> 00:49:47.988
We have the $500,
the pocket translator...

00:49:47.989 --> 00:49:50.782
the two first-class seats...
that's an upgrade from your coach...

00:49:50.783 --> 00:49:54.703
- Is that a real Rolex?
- Do you think it is?

00:49:54.704 --> 00:49:57.456
- No.
- But who can tell?

00:49:57.457 --> 00:50:01.543
- I also have a ring.
- That is beautiful!

00:50:01.544 --> 00:50:04.129
Come on. They're boarding.

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:07.758
This gal has offered us
two first-class tickets if we go Friday.

00:50:07.759 --> 00:50:11.386
Plus a ring, a watch,
a pocket translator, $500 and...

00:50:11.387 --> 00:50:14.223
- The earrings. You love the earrings.
- She's got her own earrings.

00:50:14.224 --> 00:50:16.975
A whole shoe box full of' em.
Dangley ones.

00:50:16.976 --> 00:50:19.061
- Come on, come on.
- No, but...

00:50:19.062 --> 00:50:21.146
I'm desperate.

00:50:21.147 --> 00:50:23.148
I'm begging you.

00:50:23.149 --> 00:50:26.769
From a mother to a mother, please.

00:50:28.071 --> 00:50:30.781
- Oh, Ed.
- Please.

00:50:30.782 --> 00:50:33.651
Oh, all right.

00:50:39.123 --> 00:50:41.250
"Dear Santa Claus.
I got a little sister last year.

00:50:41.251 --> 00:50:43.619
This year I'd rather
have some clay dough."

00:50:57.517 --> 00:50:59.518
I didn't mean it.

00:50:59.519 --> 00:51:02.813
If you come back,
I'll never be a pain in the butt again.

00:51:02.814 --> 00:51:05.975
I promise. Good night.

00:51:25.962 --> 00:51:29.332

00:51:29.382 --> 00:51:30.792

- I don't know.
- I'll give 'em a whirl.

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.048
For the kids.

00:53:02.183 --> 00:53:04.893
Hold on.
I got a coupon for that.

00:53:04.894 --> 00:53:07.764
It was in the paper this morning.

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:14.187
- 19.83.
- Okay.

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:19.817
Are you here all by yourself?

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:25.330
Ma'am, I'm eight years old.
You think I would be here alone?

00:53:25.331 --> 00:53:27.791
I don't think so.

00:53:27.792 --> 00:53:30.169
- Where's your mom?
- My mom's in the car.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.671
- And where is your father?
- He's at work.

00:53:32.672 --> 00:53:35.507
- What about your brothers and your sisters?
- I'm an only child.

00:53:35.508 --> 00:53:38.135
- Where do you live?
- I can't tell you that.

00:53:38.136 --> 00:53:41.339
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a stranger.

00:54:19.219 --> 00:54:23.214
Hello, Kevin!

00:54:24.307 --> 00:54:27.885
Shut up.

00:54:40.698 --> 00:54:42.699
I don't get it.

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.494
I mean, right now it looks
like there's nobody home.

00:54:45.495 --> 00:54:49.164
Last night the place is jumpin'.

00:54:49.165 --> 00:54:53.077
Somethin' ain't right.
Go check it out.

00:55:01.469 --> 00:55:03.512
Now?

00:55:03.513 --> 00:55:05.514
No, tomorrow, egghead. Now!

00:55:05.515 --> 00:55:08.225
Go ahead!

00:55:08.226 --> 00:55:10.636
"Now?"

00:55:27.745 --> 00:55:30.323
Shit.

00:55:31.958 --> 00:55:34.960
- Get the hell outta here.
- All right, Johnny.

00:55:34.961 --> 00:55:38.213
- But what about my money?
- What money?

00:55:38.214 --> 00:55:41.008
Acey said you had
some dough for me.

00:55:41.009 --> 00:55:45.971
- Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?
- Acey said 10%.

00:55:45.972 --> 00:55:51.101
- Too bad Acey ain't in charge no more.
- What do you mean?

00:55:51.102 --> 00:55:54.605
He's upstairs taking a bath.

00:55:54.606 --> 00:55:57.399
He'll call you when he gets out.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.401
Hey.

00:55:59.402 --> 00:56:02.487
I tell you what
I'm gonna give you, Snakes.

00:56:02.488 --> 00:56:06.450
- Snakes?
- I'm gonna give you to the count of 10...

00:56:06.451 --> 00:56:08.827
to get your ugly, yellow...

00:56:08.828 --> 00:56:13.373
no-good keister off my property
before I pump your guts full of lead.

00:56:13.374 --> 00:56:16.168
All right, Johnny, I'm sorry.
I'm goin'.

00:56:16.169 --> 00:56:19.330
One, two, ten!

00:56:38.358 --> 00:56:41.728
Keep the change,
ya filthy animal.

00:56:45.532 --> 00:56:46.433
What happened?

00:56:46.434 --> 00:56:49.993
I don't know who's in there, but
somebody just got blown away!

00:56:49.994 --> 00:56:50.520
- Huh?

00:56:50.521 --> 00:56:52.621
Somebody beat us to the job.
They're in there!

00:56:52.622 --> 00:56:56.708
Two of' em. They was arguing.
One of' em blew the other one away.

00:56:56.709 --> 00:56:58.502
- Who?
- I don't know.

00:56:58.503 --> 00:57:01.046
I thought I recognized
one of their voices.

00:57:01.047 --> 00:57:04.341
And I know I heard that name
Snakes before.

00:57:04.342 --> 00:57:06.969
Snakes? Snakes, Snakes.

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:09.179
- I don't know no Snakes.
- Snakes.

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:11.924
Let's get out of here.

00:57:14.143 --> 00:57:16.895
Hold it, hold it.
Let's wait and see who it is.

00:57:16.896 --> 00:57:18.897
We work this neighborhood too.

00:57:18.898 --> 00:57:21.817
- Yeah.
- Supposin' the cops finger us for a job...

00:57:21.818 --> 00:57:24.903
and they start asking us questions
about a murder in the area.

00:57:24.904 --> 00:57:28.232
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a face to go with their questions?

00:57:29.909 --> 00:57:31.994
That's a good idea.

00:57:31.995 --> 00:57:35.539
Of course it's a good idea.
Snakes?

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:38.618
He sounded like a snake.

00:57:42.505 --> 00:57:45.716
Everything's full.

00:57:45.717 --> 00:57:47.718
Everything's full?

00:57:47.719 --> 00:57:50.053
I'm very sorry,
but it is Christmas Eve.

00:57:50.054 --> 00:57:52.382
What about another airline?

00:57:57.604 --> 00:58:00.689
Nothing available. May I help you
get a hotel room in the city?

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:03.009
Tomorrow afternoon we can
get you a flight to Chicago.

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:04.276
I can't wait that long.

00:58:04.277 --> 00:58:08.898
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am, but we're
doing absolutely everything we can.

00:58:12.869 --> 00:58:16.079
Go ahead. I'm in your way.
You have places to go, people to see.

00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.541
You got a ticket there.
That's good. Excuse me. Look.

00:58:19.542 --> 00:58:23.629
I have been awake for almost 60 hours.
I'm tired and I'm dirty.

00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:28.217
I have been from Chicago to Paris
to Dallas to... Where the hell am I?

00:58:28.218 --> 00:58:30.302
Scranton.

00:58:30.303 --> 00:58:33.096
I am trying to get home
to my eight-year-old son!

00:58:33.097 --> 00:58:36.600
And now that I'm this close,
you're telling me it's hopeless?

00:58:36.601 --> 00:58:40.312
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no, no way. This is Christmas!

00:58:40.313 --> 00:58:42.314
The season of perpetual hope!

00:58:42.315 --> 00:58:43.131
Ma'am, if I...

00:58:43.132 --> 00:58:46.235
If I have to get out on
your runway and hitchhike...

00:58:46.236 --> 00:58:48.278
if it costs me everything I own...

00:58:48.279 --> 00:58:51.240
if I have to sell my soul
to the devil himself...

00:58:51.241 --> 00:58:54.493
I am going to get home
to my son.

00:58:54.494 --> 00:58:57.822
Ma'am, if there was anything at
all I could do for you today...

00:58:57.823 --> 00:58:58.747
Do it.

00:58:58.748 --> 00:59:01.458
- Do anything.
- I can get you a hotel room.

00:59:01.459 --> 00:59:03.961
- What?
- Excuse me.

00:59:03.962 --> 00:59:09.800
Can you excuse us for a second? Can I see
you for a second? Please. Excuse us. Come.

00:59:09.801 --> 00:59:13.095
Couldn't help but hearin'
you got a little bit of a dilemma there.

00:59:13.096 --> 00:59:15.806
We got a crisis ourselves.

00:59:15.807 --> 00:59:19.351
Allow me to introduce myself.
Gus Polinski. How are you?

00:59:19.352 --> 00:59:22.972
Polka king of the Midwest?

00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:28.485
The Kenosha Kickers?

00:59:28.486 --> 00:59:30.279
- Hi there.
- Hiya.

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:33.198
No? That's okay. I thought
you might've recognized...

00:59:33.199 --> 00:59:36.243
Anyways, uh, I had
a few hits a few years ago.

00:59:36.244 --> 00:59:39.739
Uh, that's why, you know...
"Polka, Polka, Polka"?

00:59:42.125 --> 00:59:44.209
No? "Twin Lakes Polka."

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:47.796
"Yamahoozie Polka,"
a.k.a. "Kiss Me Polka."

00:59:47.797 --> 00:59:50.507
- "Polka Twist."
- These are songs?

00:59:50.508 --> 00:59:54.011
Yeah. Yeah. We...
Some fairly big hits for us.

00:59:54.012 --> 00:59:56.722
- You know, in the early '70s, you know?
- Oh.

00:59:56.723 --> 00:59:59.474
Yeah, we sold
about 623 copies of that.

00:59:59.475 --> 01:00:02.186
- In Chicago?
- No. Sheboygan. Very big in Sheboygan.

01:00:02.187 --> 01:00:04.479
I'm sorry. Did you say
you could help me?

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.690
Anyway, I'm rambling on here.

01:00:06.691 --> 01:00:09.860
Our flight was canceled,
so we gotta drive.

01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:13.530
So, uh, see the guy in the yellow jacket
over there by the Budget sign?

01:00:13.531 --> 01:00:17.367
He's gonna rent us a nice big, uh, van,
and we're gonna drive to Milwaukee.

01:00:17.368 --> 01:00:21.788
I heard you had some problems here, uh, gettin'
to Chicago to see your kid or somethin'?

01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:26.001
Uh, my son. He...
We left and he's there.

01:00:26.002 --> 01:00:30.214
Aw, geez. If you have to get
to Chicago, we'll gladly drive you.

01:00:30.215 --> 01:00:32.549
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:35.302
- You'd give me a ride?
- Sure we will. Why not, you know?

01:00:35.303 --> 01:00:37.930
- You gotta get home and see your kid.
- A ride to Chicago?

01:00:37.931 --> 01:00:39.890
Sure. You know,
it's Christmastime.

01:00:39.891 --> 01:00:42.559
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.937
If you don't mind goin'
with some polka bums.

01:00:44.938 --> 01:00:47.056
No, I'd love to.

01:01:08.586 --> 01:01:11.588
- Hey, Marv, Marv, Marv.
- What?

01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:14.250
Look at this.

01:01:18.596 --> 01:01:23.176
I think we're gettin' scammed
by a "kindygartener."

01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:55.833
Dad, can you come here
and help me?

01:02:00.138 --> 01:02:04.474
Remember that kid we saw
the other day? He lives here.

01:02:04.475 --> 01:02:07.477
Well, if the kid's there,
the parents gotta be.

01:02:07.478 --> 01:02:10.264
He's home alone.

01:02:17.947 --> 01:02:20.365
You gotta be kiddin'.
You wanna come back tonight?

01:02:20.366 --> 01:02:22.367
- Uh-huh.
- Even with the kid here?

01:02:22.368 --> 01:02:24.620
- Uh-huh.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

01:02:24.621 --> 01:02:28.165
That house is the only reason we started
workin' this block in the first place.

01:02:28.166 --> 01:02:31.001
Ever since I laid eyes
on that house, I wanted it.

01:02:31.002 --> 01:02:33.462
So let's take it
one step at a time, okay?

01:02:33.463 --> 01:02:37.049
We'll unload the van. We'll get a bite
to eat. We'll come back about 9:00.

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:40.052
- This way it's dark then.

01:02:40.053 --> 01:02:43.305
Yeah. Kids are scared
of the dark.

01:02:43.306 --> 01:02:46.225
You're afraid of the dark too, Marv.
You know you are.

01:02:46.226 --> 01:02:49.019
No, I'm not!

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.647
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not, not, not.

01:02:51.648 --> 01:02:56.060
- You are so.
- Mom, where are you?

01:03:09.249 --> 01:03:11.250
Do you play?

01:03:11.251 --> 01:03:13.418
You want to try it?
Go ahead. Try it.

01:03:13.419 --> 01:03:15.796
- Try it. Try it.
- No.

01:03:15.797 --> 01:03:18.041
Okay.

01:03:42.073 --> 01:03:45.617
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

01:03:45.618 --> 01:03:49.705
- Hey, nice shoes.
- Oh, thanks.

01:03:49.706 --> 01:03:53.417
Is he still here? It's really important
that I see him.

01:03:53.418 --> 01:03:58.797
He's getting in his car. I guess
if you hurry, you can catch him.

01:03:58.798 --> 01:04:03.385
Damn! How low can you get? Givin' Kris
Kringle a parking ticket on Christmas Eve.

01:04:03.386 --> 01:04:06.597
What's next?
Rabies shots for the Easter Bunny?

01:04:06.598 --> 01:04:09.266
Santa, hold on!

01:04:09.267 --> 01:04:11.476
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:04:11.477 --> 01:04:14.605
If you make it quick. Santa's got
a little get-together he's late for.

01:04:14.606 --> 01:04:16.607
Okay. I know you're not
the real Santa Claus.

01:04:16.608 --> 01:04:20.611
What makes you say that?
Just out of curiosity.

01:04:20.612 --> 01:04:23.322
I'm old enough
to know how it works.

01:04:23.323 --> 01:04:26.491
- All right.
- But I also know that you work for him.

01:04:26.492 --> 01:04:29.620
- And I'd like you to give him a message.
- Shoot.

01:04:29.621 --> 01:04:33.832
I'm Kevin McCallister,
671 Lincoln Boulevard.

01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:36.627
- Do you need the phone number?
- No, that's all right.

01:04:36.628 --> 01:04:38.921
Okay.
This is extremely important.

01:04:38.922 --> 01:04:43.800
Would you please tell him that, instead of
presents this year, I just want my family back.

01:04:43.801 --> 01:04:48.805
No toys. Nothing but Peter,
Kate, Buzz, Megan, Linnie and Jeff.

01:04:48.806 --> 01:04:51.141
And my aunt and my cousins.

01:04:51.142 --> 01:04:54.512
And, if he has time,
my Uncle Frank. Okay?

01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:59.316
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

01:04:59.317 --> 01:05:02.319
- Thanks.
- Wait. Hold on a second.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.572
My elf took the last of the candy canes
home to her boyfriend.

01:05:05.573 --> 01:05:07.699
- That's okay.
- No, no, no. Don't be silly.

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.827
Everybody who sees Santa
has gotta get... somethin'.

01:05:10.828 --> 01:05:13.121
Here. Hold out
your little paw there.

01:05:13.122 --> 01:05:16.333
There you go.
Don't spoil your dinner.

01:05:16.334 --> 01:05:19.120
I won't. Thanks.

01:05:29.848 --> 01:05:32.592
Son of a...

01:08:28.568 --> 01:08:30.903
Merry Christmas.

01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:32.487
Huh?

01:08:32.488 --> 01:08:34.732
May I sit down?

01:08:45.001 --> 01:08:49.706
That's my granddaughter up there.
The little red-haired girl.

01:08:51.716 --> 01:08:53.509
She's about your age.

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:55.844
- Do you know her?
- No.

01:08:55.845 --> 01:08:59.014
- You live next to me, don't you?
- Yeah.

01:08:59.015 --> 01:09:03.560
You can say hello when you see me.
You don't have to be afraid.

01:09:03.561 --> 01:09:07.564
There's a lot of things going around
about me, but none of it's true.

01:09:07.565 --> 01:09:09.566
Okay?

01:09:09.567 --> 01:09:11.902
- You been a good boy this year?
- I think so.

01:09:11.903 --> 01:09:14.071
Swear to it?

01:09:14.072 --> 01:09:16.907
- No.
- Yeah, I had a feeling.

01:09:16.908 --> 01:09:20.118
Well, this is the place to be
if you're feeling bad about yourself.

01:09:20.119 --> 01:09:23.121
- It is?
- I think so.

01:09:23.122 --> 01:09:26.034
- Are you feeling bad about yourself?
- No.

01:09:30.088 --> 01:09:32.422
I've been kind of a pain lately.

01:09:32.423 --> 01:09:34.925
I said some things
I shouldn't have.

01:09:34.926 --> 01:09:38.303
I really haven't been
too good this year.

01:09:38.304 --> 01:09:41.265
- Yeah.
- I'm kind of upset about it...

01:09:41.266 --> 01:09:43.517
because I really like my family.

01:09:43.518 --> 01:09:46.144
Even though sometimes
I say I don't.

01:09:46.145 --> 01:09:49.648
Sometimes I even think I don't.
Do you get that?

01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:54.278
I think so. How you feel about
your family is a complicated thing.

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:57.865
Especially with an older brother.

01:09:57.866 --> 01:10:02.244
Deep down you always love 'em,
but you can forget that you love 'em.

01:10:02.245 --> 01:10:05.038
And you can hurt them,
and they can hurt you.

01:10:05.039 --> 01:10:08.876
And that's not just
because you're young.

01:10:08.877 --> 01:10:12.212
You want to know the real reason
that I'm here right now?

01:10:12.213 --> 01:10:14.214
Sure.

01:10:14.215 --> 01:10:17.968
I came to hear my granddaughter sing,
and I can't come and hear her tonight.

01:10:17.969 --> 01:10:23.682
- You have plans?
- No. I'm not welcome.

01:10:23.683 --> 01:10:27.644
- At church?
- Oh, you're always welcome at church.

01:10:27.645 --> 01:10:30.147
I'm not welcome with my son.

01:10:30.148 --> 01:10:34.943
Years back, before you and
your family moved on the block...

01:10:34.944 --> 01:10:37.529
I had an argument with my son.

01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:41.867
- How old is he?
- Oh, he's grown up.

01:10:41.868 --> 01:10:44.620
We lost our tempers...

01:10:44.621 --> 01:10:47.664
and I said I didn't care
to see him anymore.

01:10:47.665 --> 01:10:52.669
He said the same, and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:55.631
If you miss him,
why don't you call him?

01:10:55.632 --> 01:10:58.425
I'm afraid if I call him,
he won't talk to me.

01:10:58.426 --> 01:11:00.719
How do you know?

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.847
I don't know.
I'm just afraid he won't.

01:11:03.848 --> 01:11:07.643
No offense, but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?

01:11:07.644 --> 01:11:11.271
You can be a little old
for a lot of things.

01:11:11.272 --> 01:11:13.607
You're never too old
to be afraid.

01:11:13.608 --> 01:11:16.485
That's true. I've always
been afraid of our basement.

01:11:16.486 --> 01:11:20.030
It's dark, there's weird stuff
down there, and it smells funny.

01:11:20.031 --> 01:11:23.534
That sort of thing.
It's bothered me for years.

01:11:23.535 --> 01:11:26.036
Basements are like that.

01:11:26.037 --> 01:11:29.039
Then I made myself go down there
to do some laundry...

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.124
and I found out
it's not so bad.

01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:33.544
All this time
I've been worrying about it...

01:11:33.545 --> 01:11:35.879
but if you turn on the lights,
it's no big deal.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.425
- What's your point?
- My point is you should call your son.

01:11:40.426 --> 01:11:42.594
What if he won't talk to me?

01:11:42.595 --> 01:11:46.056
At least you'll know.
Then you could stop worrying about it...

01:11:46.057 --> 01:11:48.725
and you won't have to be
afraid anymore.

01:11:48.726 --> 01:11:52.396
I don't care how mad I was,
I'd talk to my dad...

01:11:52.397 --> 01:11:54.398
especially around the holidays.

01:11:54.399 --> 01:11:57.651
I don't know.

01:11:57.652 --> 01:12:00.904
Just give it a shot.
For your granddaughter anyway.

01:12:00.905 --> 01:12:04.408
I'm sure she misses you...
and the presents.

01:12:04.409 --> 01:12:06.368
I send her a check.

01:12:06.369 --> 01:12:10.747
I wish my grandparents sent that.
They always send me clothes.

01:12:10.748 --> 01:12:13.750
Last year I got a sweater
with a big bird knitted on it.

01:12:13.751 --> 01:12:17.129
- Oh, that's nice.
- Not for a guy in the second grade.

01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:20.215
You can get beat up
for wearing something like that.

01:12:20.216 --> 01:12:22.426
- Oh?
- Yeah.

01:12:22.427 --> 01:12:26.638
I have a friend who got nailed 'cause there
was a rumor he wore dinosaur pajamas.

01:12:26.639 --> 01:12:30.058
You'd better run along home
where you belong.

01:12:30.059 --> 01:12:32.060
You think about what I said.

01:12:32.061 --> 01:12:33.937
- All right?
- Okay.

01:12:33.938 --> 01:12:38.017
- It was nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:47.117
- What about you?
- Me?

01:12:47.118 --> 01:12:49.244
Yeah. You and your son.

01:12:49.245 --> 01:12:52.623
We'll see what happens.

01:12:52.624 --> 01:12:55.667
Merry Christmas.

01:12:55.668 --> 01:12:57.787
Merry Christmas.

01:13:50.348 --> 01:13:54.552
This is my house.
I have to defend it.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:26.018
Okay, we'll check it out first.
We can always come back for the truck.

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:34.785
How do you wanna go in?

01:15:34.786 --> 01:15:38.330
We'll go to the back door.
Maybe he'll let us in. You never know.

01:15:38.331 --> 01:15:41.993
Yeah. He's a kid.
Kids are stupid.

01:15:43.837 --> 01:15:47.840
Bless this highly nutritious microwavable
macaroni and cheese dinner...

01:15:47.841 --> 01:15:49.967
and the people
who sold it on sale.

01:15:49.968 --> 01:15:52.086
Amen.

01:16:15.743 --> 01:16:18.821
This is it.
Don't get scared now.

01:16:31.926 --> 01:16:34.511
Merry Christmas, little fella.

01:16:34.512 --> 01:16:37.181
We know that you're in there...

01:16:37.182 --> 01:16:40.184
and that you're all alone.

01:16:40.185 --> 01:16:42.895
Yeah, come on, kid. Open up.

01:16:42.896 --> 01:16:46.641
It's Santa Claus and his elf.

01:16:47.859 --> 01:16:50.194
We're not gonna hurt you.

01:16:50.195 --> 01:16:54.239
No, no. We got
some nice presents for you.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.902
Be a good little fella now
and open the door.

01:17:00.622 --> 01:17:03.498
Shoot!

01:17:03.499 --> 01:17:07.377
What? What? What?

01:17:07.378 --> 01:17:10.506
What? What happened?

01:17:10.507 --> 01:17:14.252
Get that little...

01:17:23.394 --> 01:17:25.763
Hello.

01:17:30.902 --> 01:17:33.445
Yes! Yes!

01:17:33.446 --> 01:17:35.614
The little jerk is armed!

01:17:35.615 --> 01:17:39.618
That's it! That's it! I'm goin' around
the front! You go down the basement!

01:17:39.619 --> 01:17:42.280
That little...

01:18:18.366 --> 01:18:20.610
Ow!

01:18:42.056 --> 01:18:44.467
That smart aleck.

01:20:12.021 --> 01:20:17.067
Oh, boy, that's it, you little...
you little son of a...

01:20:17.068 --> 01:20:20.229
Oh, not this time,
you little brat.

01:20:23.616 --> 01:20:26.201
You little creep, you,
where are you?

01:20:26.202 --> 01:20:30.573
Where are you, you little creep?

01:20:50.101 --> 01:20:54.222
Yes! Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:21:24.761 --> 01:21:27.755
I'll rip his head off!

01:21:33.811 --> 01:21:38.725
You're dead, kid.

01:22:25.572 --> 01:22:28.900
Where are you,
you little creep?

01:22:44.048 --> 01:22:47.877
Harry! I'm comin' in!

01:22:52.307 --> 01:22:54.808
Oh, no, I'm really scared!

01:22:54.809 --> 01:22:57.561
It's too late for you, kid.
We're already in the house.

01:22:57.562 --> 01:23:01.732
- We're gonna get you!
- Okay. Come and get me.

01:23:01.733 --> 01:23:04.477
Why, you...

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:11.401
Now you're dead!

01:23:35.475 --> 01:23:38.177
I'm gonna kill that kid!

01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:55.619
- Marv!
- Harry?

01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.746
Why the hell'd
you take your shoes off?

01:23:57.747 --> 01:24:01.075
Why the hell are you
dressed like a chicken?

01:24:02.293 --> 01:24:06.247
I'm up here, you morons!
Come and get me!

01:24:08.258 --> 01:24:12.128
You guys give up,
or are you thirsty for more?

01:24:21.646 --> 01:24:24.189
- Heads up!
- Huh?

01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:27.484
Don't worry, Marv. I'll get him for you.

01:24:27.485 --> 01:24:31.113
Ow!

01:24:31.114 --> 01:24:34.692
Yes!

01:24:38.663 --> 01:24:41.498
He's only a kid, Harry.
We can take him.

01:24:41.499 --> 01:24:43.584
- Aw, shut up, will ya!
- Oh!

01:24:43.585 --> 01:24:46.670
- What is it?
- You're missin' some teeth.

01:24:46.671 --> 01:24:51.008
Where? It's my gold tooth.
My gold tooth! I'll kill him!

01:24:51.009 --> 01:24:54.511
I'll kill him!

01:24:54.512 --> 01:24:57.389
You bomb me
with one more can, kid...

01:24:57.390 --> 01:25:01.761
and I'll snap off your cojones
and boil them in motor oil!

01:25:04.022 --> 01:25:06.231
911 Emergency.

01:25:06.232 --> 01:25:09.067
Help. My house is being robbed.

01:25:09.068 --> 01:25:13.856
My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard.
My name's Murphy.

01:25:16.367 --> 01:25:19.036
Watch it. You never know
what's up there.

01:25:19.037 --> 01:25:22.115
There he is!

01:25:23.041 --> 01:25:26.251
Ah! I got ya!

01:25:26.252 --> 01:25:29.713
I got him, Harry!
Harry, I got him!

01:25:29.714 --> 01:25:32.883
Harry, get up! Give me a hand!

01:25:32.884 --> 01:25:37.179
Ow! I got him!

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:40.766
Harry, help me! Get up!

01:25:40.767 --> 01:25:43.720
I got him!

01:26:22.058 --> 01:26:26.979
- What are you doing, Marv?
- Harry, don't move.

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:31.066
- Marv?
- Don't... move!

01:26:31.067 --> 01:26:34.562
Marv, what are you doing?
Marv...

01:26:37.448 --> 01:26:41.118
Did I get him?
Did I get him?

01:26:41.119 --> 01:26:43.579
Where is it?
Where is it?

01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:46.832
Never mind did you get it!
How do you like it? Huh?

01:26:46.833 --> 01:26:50.828
You jerk! Get that kid!
Go on! Get the kid!

01:26:54.007 --> 01:26:57.509
Whoa! Whoa!

01:26:57.510 --> 01:27:01.096
Whoa! Whoa!

01:27:01.097 --> 01:27:04.425
Whoa! Whoa!

01:27:16.779 --> 01:27:18.989
Where'd he go?

01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:21.158
Maybe he committed suicide.

01:27:21.159 --> 01:27:23.368
Down here, you big horse's ass!

01:27:23.369 --> 01:27:26.455
Come and get me
before I call the police!

01:27:26.456 --> 01:27:28.707
- Let's get him!
- Wait. Wait.

01:27:28.708 --> 01:27:30.792
That's just what
he wants us to do...

01:27:30.793 --> 01:27:34.379
us to go back downstairs through
his fun house so we get all tore up.

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.674
- He's gonna call the cops!
- He's not callin' the... From a tree house?

01:27:37.675 --> 01:27:39.676
Come on.

01:27:39.677 --> 01:27:42.054
- Out the window?
- Yeah.

01:27:42.055 --> 01:27:44.848
- I'm not goin' out the window.
- Why? Are you scared, Marv?

01:27:44.849 --> 01:27:47.635
Are you afraid?
Come on. Get out here.

01:27:52.023 --> 01:27:54.142
Come on.

01:27:57.529 --> 01:27:58.273
Come on!

01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:08.539
Come on.
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:11.583
- Let's go back, Harry.
- Shut up!

01:28:11.584 --> 01:28:14.920
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

01:28:14.921 --> 01:28:17.957
Shut it, Marv!

01:28:20.218 --> 01:28:23.220
Hey, guys, check this out.

01:28:23.221 --> 01:28:26.098
Go back! Go back!

01:28:26.099 --> 01:28:27.800
- Go back.
- Okay.

01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:57.038
There he goes! There he is!
Get out of the way, you dope!

01:29:14.439 --> 01:29:19.276
- There he is!
- Hey, I'm calling the cops.

01:29:19.277 --> 01:29:22.279
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
He wants us to follow him.

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.607
I got a better idea.
Come on.

01:29:41.341 --> 01:29:45.802
Hiya, pal.
We outsmarted you this time.

01:29:45.803 --> 01:29:48.965
Get over here!

01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:54.436
What are we
gonna do to him, Harry?

01:29:54.437 --> 01:29:58.941
We'll do exactly what he did to us.
I'm gonna burn his head with a blowtorch.

01:29:58.942 --> 01:30:01.151
Then we can smash his face
with an iron!

01:30:01.152 --> 01:30:05.155
I'd like to slap him right in the face
with a paint can maybe.

01:30:05.156 --> 01:30:07.783
Or shove a nail through his foot.

01:30:07.784 --> 01:30:11.237
I'm gonna bite off every one
of these little fingers one at a time.

01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:23.166
Come on.
Let's get you home.

01:30:44.696 --> 01:30:49.067
Wow. This is great.

01:30:51.536 --> 01:30:54.496
Nice move... always leaving
the water running.

01:30:54.497 --> 01:30:57.909
Now we know each and
every house that you've hit.

01:31:00.670 --> 01:31:04.423
Hey, you know, we've been looking
for you two guys for a long time.

01:31:04.424 --> 01:31:07.509
- Yeah.
- Well, remember, we're the Wet Bandits.

01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:11.722
- Wet Bandits. W-E-T...
- Shut up! Get in the car!

01:31:11.723 --> 01:31:14.683
Hey, come on. Come on.

01:31:14.684 --> 01:31:17.220
- Hands off the head, pal!
- Come on!

01:32:12.742 --> 01:32:15.410
I'm a bad parent.
I'm a bad parent.

01:32:15.411 --> 01:32:18.455
You're not. You know, you're beating
yourself up there, you know.

01:32:18.456 --> 01:32:21.124
Come on. This happens.
These things happen. You know, you...

01:32:21.125 --> 01:32:24.628
Gee, you wanna talk about bad parents?
Look at... Look at us.

01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:29.132
I mean, we're on the road 48, 49 weeks out of the year.
We hardly see our families.

01:32:29.133 --> 01:32:32.636
Uh, Joe over there... Gosh, you know, he...

01:32:32.637 --> 01:32:35.472
He forgets his kids' names
half the time.

01:32:35.473 --> 01:32:39.309
Ziggy over there... He doesn't even...
He's never even met his kid.

01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:43.105
Eddie... Let's just hope none
of them write a book about him.

01:32:43.106 --> 01:32:48.144
Tell me, have you ever gone on vacation
and left your child home?

01:32:50.822 --> 01:32:52.990
No.

01:32:52.991 --> 01:32:56.535
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.

01:32:56.536 --> 01:32:58.829
Yeah, it was...
it was terrible too.

01:32:58.830 --> 01:33:02.249
You know, I was all distraught and
everything. You know, the wife and I...

01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:06.336
we left the little tyke
there in the funeral parlor all day.

01:33:06.337 --> 01:33:10.340
All day. You know, and we went back
at night when we came to our senses.

01:33:10.341 --> 01:33:13.969
And there he was. Apparently he was
there alone all day with a corpse.

01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:16.680
- Oh!
- Whew, yeah. He was okay, you know.

01:33:16.681 --> 01:33:21.685
After six, seven weeks, you know, he
came around and started talking again.

01:33:21.686 --> 01:33:26.231
But he's okay. You know, they get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.

01:33:26.232 --> 01:33:29.067
- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
- Well, you brought it up.

01:33:29.068 --> 01:33:32.313
- I was just trying to cheer you up.
- Well, I'm sorry I did.

01:33:58.014 --> 01:34:00.091
Mom?

01:34:04.479 --> 01:34:06.556
Mom?

01:34:09.776 --> 01:34:12.729
Mom?

01:34:58.283 --> 01:35:02.528
Kevin? Kevin!

01:35:33.318 --> 01:35:35.812
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

01:35:44.829 --> 01:35:47.740
Oh, Kevin, I'm so sorry.

01:36:07.101 --> 01:36:09.353
Where is everybody else?

01:36:09.354 --> 01:36:13.524
Oh, baby, they couldn't come.
They wanted to so much, but...

01:36:13.525 --> 01:36:18.195
I didn't fall asleep in the back of the cab
and drool all over you, did I?

01:36:18.196 --> 01:36:20.572
- I don't drool.
- You guys, would you shut up!

01:36:20.573 --> 01:36:24.034
Come on, you guys, it's Christmas.
Kevin! Kevin, Kevin, my boy!

01:36:24.035 --> 01:36:26.036
- Oh, my God!
- Kevin, how are ya?

01:36:26.037 --> 01:36:28.038
- Merry Christmas.
- Hi, Mom.

01:36:28.039 --> 01:36:30.874
Good to see you. Ah, you're all right.
I love you. You okay?

01:36:30.875 --> 01:36:33.703
- Yeah.
- Hey, Kev.

01:36:35.588 --> 01:36:39.258
It's pretty cool that
you didn't burn the place down.

01:36:39.259 --> 01:36:43.178
Thanks, Buzz.

01:36:43.179 --> 01:36:46.181
Wait a minute.
How did you guys get home?

01:36:46.182 --> 01:36:49.601
Oh, we took the morning flight. Remember?
The one you didn't want to wait for.

01:36:49.602 --> 01:36:52.396
Oh, no.
Oh, thank you.

01:36:52.397 --> 01:36:54.398
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:36:54.399 --> 01:36:56.981
Someone has to find an open store.
We don't have milk.

01:36:56.982 --> 01:36:58.669
I went shopping yesterday.

01:37:00.864 --> 01:37:02.739
You? Shopping?

01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:05.860
I got some milk, eggs
and fabric softener.

01:37:07.203 --> 01:37:09.663
- What?
- No kiddin'?

01:37:09.664 --> 01:37:13.876
What a funny guy. What else did
you do while we were away?

01:37:13.877 --> 01:37:16.954
Just hung around.

01:37:19.591 --> 01:37:21.842
You guys,
put the stuff upstairs.

01:37:21.843 --> 01:37:25.762
You went shopping? He doesn't know how
to tie his shoe, and he's going shopping?

01:37:25.763 --> 01:37:28.716
- Buzz, forget it.
- This is not the Kevin I knew.

01:37:51.956 --> 01:37:54.492
Honey, what's this?

01:38:51.933 --> 01:38:55.762
Kevin!
What did you do to my room?
